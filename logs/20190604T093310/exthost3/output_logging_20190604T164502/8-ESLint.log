Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /home/malav/Desktop/gateway/nest_project_final/final-project/quickfix_examples/acceptor.js

To use ESLint please install eslint by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder final-project
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn or pnpm instead of npm set the setting `eslint.packageManager` to either `yarn` or `pnpm`
Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder final-project by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
